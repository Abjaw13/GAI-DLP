        "Query 2 : What is the first rule of Fight Club?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer : A question that gets to the heart of subversion and rebellion!\n",
        "\n",
        "The first rule of Fight Club is: \"You do not talk about Fight Club.\" This enigmatic rule, introduced by Tyler Durden in Chuck Palahniuk's novel \"Fight Club\" (1996) and adapted into a iconic film by David Fincher (1999), sets the tone for a world where mainstream values are turned upside down. By refusing to acknowledge or discuss Fight Club, its members are able to maintain an air of secrecy and anonymity, allowing them to confront the emptiness and disillusionment of modern life.\n",
        "\n",
        "This first rule also serves as a commentary on our society's obsession with consumerism and material possessions. In a world where people are more concerned with appearances and possessions than genuine human connections, Fight Club becomes a space for its members to break free from these constraints and connect with each other on a deeper level.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you delve into the world of Fight Club, be prepared to question the norms of society and challenge your own perceptions of identity, community, and rebellion."
